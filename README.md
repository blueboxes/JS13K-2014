# Element War - JS13K Games 2014 Entry

## About

This is my 2014 js13kgames entrya nd my first ever entry in to the competition. 

## Playing Instructions  

You must collect the elements in the order shown, all other elements must be destroyed.

For example if the mission is to collect earth then water elements. If water element appears first you must destroy it and any other elements until you have collected an earth element. Then collect the water element destroying all others. The mission is complete when all the elements in your mission have been collected. The game is over if an element passes you or you collect the incorrect element.

Points are awarded for destroying elements and completing the missions however points are subtracted for hitting an element you are meant to collect.
